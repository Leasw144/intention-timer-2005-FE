# INTENTION TIMER 2005 FE
## Overview
##### This is an application that allows a user to set goals for their health and productivity, tied to an amount of time. Users will select an activity category, set the amount of time they want to spend on that activity, and start the timer. The app will log that activity to keep track of how the user has been spending their time</br>

#### TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY

* We came together and completed day1 deliverables: primarily the "git" setup(new directory, cloning, contributors, new directory containing the following files:
index.html
styles.css
activity.js
main.js
assets/icon files
* Spent time completing the DTR as a group effort, review of project spec. briefly as a group and individually.  
* Provided project manager with links to DTR and Repo.
* We agreed that our schedules lined up with little or no interference for project work on weekday evenings and weekends and any other allotted work time in our daily schedules.
* Utilizing kanban in the project pages for tracking and organization of project.
* Immediately began work on Iteration 0 with driver/navigator, copious git commits(throughout).
* Tuesday/Wednesday we focused Iteration 0-1 with primarily driver/navigator with html/css Steph/Linus and Jeff but Jeff also beginning work on Timer research and breakdown and all of us beginning to look at Iteration2. </br>

</br>

#### Friday/Weekend
* Friday/weekend: Steph worked on Exercise, Meditate, or Study button functions, and CSS for the associated border and icon change of colors to give a visual indication that it has been selected. Jeff worked on the form functionality and all of its inputs requirements - with minutes and seconds fields only accept numbers, and no "e" in the user inputs. Linus took on the functionality of the start activity button and all of its features. We did divide and conquer for some of this and then would come back together for help and driver/navigator sessions to check our code and troubleshoot.
#### The Final Stretch
* Tuesday and Wednesday have proved to be our most effective driving days with crunch time approaching focus was strong and team effort was present. Everyone working well together.
* Finishing up input details to bring us to the new page with the timer and start button present - troubleshooting through many glitches, using dev tools, google, codepen, rocks, mentors, etc.
* During off-time (late night/early mornings), divide and conquer approach was used, working on various parts of iterations 0 - 3.
* Iteration4 - Jeff tackled this towards the very end of the project and got some good working functionality by clicking Log Activity, a card with the category, time, and the users input for What would you like to accomplish during this time appears on the card in right section of comp
* Refactoring.
