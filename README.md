#### TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY

* We came together and completed day1 deliverables: primarily the "git" setup(new directory, cloning, contributors, new directory containing the following files:
index.html
styles.css
activity.js
main.js
assets/icon files
* Spent time completing the DTR as a group effort, review of project spec. briefly as a group and individually.  
* Provided project manager with links to DTR and Repo.
* We agreed that our schedules lined up with little or no interference for project work on weekday evenings and weekends and any other allotted work time in our daily schedules.
* Utilizing kanban in the project pages for tracking and organization of project.
* Immediately began work on Iteration 0 with driver/navigator, copious git commits.
Thursday we completed Iteration 1 with driver/navigator(Steph driving), git commits/push/pull.
Today, Friday, we are completing Iteration 2, driver/navigator. See project pages for Iter2 details.
Sunday we began work around 11:30am to 3:30pm (poms included) on Iteration 3, driver/navigator and a little bit of divide and conquer, research, pseudo-coding our own ideas for the iteration. Coming together and trying various set ups to get the dom/browser working effectively with understandable DRY code in main.js completed the iteration, start on Iteration 4 tomorrow/Sunday.
Sunday we focused on Iteration 4 and began the day together at 3pm until about 5:30pm with driver/navigator, getting stuck and taking a long break. During off-time (late night/early mornings), divide and conquer approach was used, working on various parts of iterations 0 - 3. 
Monday/Tuesday we worked on and completed iteration 5 and looked through additional features, played around with mouseover/hover event for the mini pictures. Josh got the savedView display to work in rows instead of columns(by saving it in the correct section of innerHTML). Refactoring.
